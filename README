Project 1

This directory constitutes the contents of my submission for Project 1.

The project is written in C. I did not download any new libraries, so as long as you
have gcc and make you should be able to build this project. The project comes with a basic
Makefile. Simply invoke `make` on the command line to build disasm and invoke `make clean`
to remove disasm. The binary should be runnable with the one argument given in the project spec.

A quick summary of the files and their contents:
register.c/.h - functions and types relevant to register parsing
modrm.c/.h - functions and types relevant to modrm byte parsing
sib.c/.h - functions and types relevant to sib byte parsing
prefix.c/.h - functions and types relevant to prefix parsing
op.c/.h - functions and types relevant to opcode parsing
instr.c/.h - functions and types relevant to full instruction parsing
lin.c/.h - implementation of the linear sweep dissassembly algorithm
label.c/.h - implementation of a supporting struct that holds labels and corresponding addresses for the
             printing step
list.c/.h - barebones implementation of a linked list with desired functionality
main.c/.h - main; handles command line input and instruction printing

This directory is also a local git repo, so the full history of development should also be browsable, if
so desired.

The written response document is also located in this directory in the file "guinn_proj1_submission.pdf."
